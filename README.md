# InteractiveComputing
In Interactive Computing, I developed multimedia applications for both the desktop and the web, focusing on general programming techniques with an emphasis on the production of interactive graphical environments.
To ensure a seamless user experience, I employed a combination of cutting-edge web technologies, such as P5.JS, HTML, CSS, and A-FRAME.
